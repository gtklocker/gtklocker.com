I wish to improve my security practices.

In that direction, I have placed a bounty on finding a file, ~/.bounty, on my
development machine, schwarz (a Macbook).

I invite you to find the file and share its contents with me. If you have found
it, a reward of 50€ will be given to you in BTC.

Furthermore, I invite you to post a message from my Facebook account in the
form of "Bounty claimed by @Your Name". The reward in that case is 5€.

Rules:
* Full disclosure required.
* Do not purposely leave any attack vectors behind.
* No physical violence.
* No threatening me or people I love.
* No break-ins. It's OK if I let you in.
* BTC/€ rates will be calculated on Google.
* Only one reward will be given per day.
* Only one reward will be given per vulnerability.

This statement is valid until superseded. The latest statement can always be
found on https://gtklocker.com/bounty.txt.
